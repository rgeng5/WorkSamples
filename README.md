**Automated MR Image Prescription of the Liver Using Deep Learning: Development, Evaluation, and Prospective Implementation**

I developed, implemented, and evaluated an AI-based (YOLOv3) fully automated prescription method for liver MRI. The AI-based automated liver image prescription demonstrated promising performance across the patients, pathologies, and field strengths studied. The demo scripts and the YOLOv3 configuration files for this work are shared [here](https://github.com/rgeng5/WorkSamples/blob/main/Liver_organ_detection/).

**Carpool optimizer app using Dijkstra's in java**

I developed a carpool optimizer app in java that allows users to figure out whether it is feasible to pick up someone requesting a lift, and if so, the best order to pick up the riders. Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is used to determine which riders are eligible for pickup, so that the total driving distance does not exceed userâ€™s tolerance. The code is [here](https://github.com/rgeng5/WorkSamples/blob/main/Carpool_optimizer_Dijkstras_java/).
